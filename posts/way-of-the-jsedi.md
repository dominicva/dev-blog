## Two stages

### Stage 1: JS & programming fundamentals

For the beginner there are two things happending at the same time

1. Learning to express logical procedures – non-programmers might never have used their brains like this before.

2. Learning the tools made available to you by a programming language – JS in our case

The good news is there's a solution: tons of practice

### Resources

#### Lecture series / recorded workshops

[Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) – maybe the only learning resource worth paying for (approx $40 per month). They're a great community. If you contact them they'd probably give you discount codes etc. In fact all of our JS fundamentals are taken care of there.

All by Will Sentance (Codesmith CEO)

- [JS the Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts-v2/)

- [JS Hard Parts of OOP](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/object-oriented-js/)

- [JS: the New Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-new-hard-parts/)

That covers pretty much all the core features under the hood. If you learned all that you could answer questions like

> what work does `super()` do for us when we extend an es6 class?
> how is async/await an abstraction layer on top of generator functions?

If you want to go really deep, then...

By Kyle Simpson, author of the [YDKJSY series](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)

- [Deep JS Foundations](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/deep-javascript-v3/). Maybe overkill for pre-bootcampers.

#### Exercises

- freeCodeCamp has loads of interactive [JS exercises](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)

- Codesmith's [CSX](https://csx.codesmith.io/)

### Stage 2: Build, learn, build

#### React

- [beta docs](https://beta.reactjs.org/) just amazing. Totally rewritten for functional components and exercises for everything

- [Intro to React](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v7/) from Frontend Masters again

- [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/) - can be bit hard to find the right content, but... look out for Kent C Dodds who has a bunch of stuff on there, which takes me to...

- [Epic React](https://epicreact.dev/) by Kent C Dodds. I would claim that this + the react beta docs are the two best resources period. You can pay like $400-500 to get full experience of video content etc. but all the repos including instructions are open source on github. Here are the first two in the series.
