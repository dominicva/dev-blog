Anyone with a hobby bordering on obsession can relate to this: we take pride in the tools we use. They help us feel like the craftsmen we aspire to be.

## The Essentials

### [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

I have plenty of custom settings, but everyone has their own preferences. I will mention two features though.

1. Macros

   This macros [extentsion](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=geddski.macros) helps you automate repetitive tasks. For example, I like to label what I `console.log`. Say I've got

   ```javascript
   const data = await fetch(url).then(r => r.json());
   ```

   With my cursor on `data`, one keystroke and I get this

   ```javascript
   const data = await fetch(url).then(r => r.json());
   console.log('data:', data);
   ```

   Makes me smile every time.

2. Snippets

### [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

The only useful thing I have to say about prettier is: **get it**.

### [Run JS](https://runjs.app/)
